## Exploratory Analysis in Python

### This is a brief exploratory analysis demonstrating some basic skills in python. 

The following files are included: 
- .ipynb file containing the original python code
- "data" folder containing the original data


Note 1: Sometimes the .ipynb file fails to load for unknown reasons - I suspect github compatibility. 
</br> Note 2: Must download data and remap filepaths on lines 4, 31, 45, and 60 to run locally.
